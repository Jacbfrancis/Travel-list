# 🌎 Travel List

A simple React app that helps users keep track of items they want to take on a trip. Users can add, check off, sort, and remove items, making trip preparation easier and more organized.
This project was built as part of the "Ultimate React Course" by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy.

## 🚀 Features

- Add items with quantity and name.
- Mark items as packed or unpack them.
- Remove items from the list.
- Sort items by input order, description, or packed status.

## 📚 What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- Rendering Lists → Using .map() to display dynamic lists of items.
- Handling Controlled Elements → Managing form input fields with state.
- State vs Props → Differentiating between local state and data passed from parents.
- Lifting State Up → Sharing state between components by moving it to a common ancestor.
- Derived State → Calculating totals like packed items vs. overall items.
